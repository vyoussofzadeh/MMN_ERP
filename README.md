# MMN_ERP
This is a 128-channel ERP data set acquired from five subjects during mismatch negativity auditory oddball (MMN-AOP) paradigm by Garrido et al. (2007). The data was recorded by a Biosemi system with a sampling rate of 512 Hz. The experiment comprised of an AOP paradigm in which participants heard two different tones, a target (550 Hz), and a standard (500 Hz) tone. The experiment had been designed in a pseudorandom sequence, allowing for 80% (480 trials) and 20% (120 trials) chance of occurrence of the standard and oddball, respectively.
